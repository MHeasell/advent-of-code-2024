I fantasized about writing some wacky symbolic execution engine to
programatically find the solution to this one, but past experience has
taught me that it's much easier to do these ones manually. :')

To solve this one I used some find and replace in vim to turn the input
into a graphviz dot file. Then I rendered it out as a PNG using

    dot graph.dot -Tpng > out.png

Then I manually looked over the connections in the PNG to find the
swapped wires.

Every input except bit 0 needs to go through two half adders before
being output, so the first thing I looked for was the sequence `input
-> XOR -> XOR -> output` for every bit.

I found the following miswirings that way:

- nqk and z07
- fpq and z24
- srn and z32

Then I looked at the carry bit wiring for every bit `input -> XOR -> AND
-> OR -> ...`.

That revealed the last miswired pair: fgt and pcp

From there we can easily sort and join by commas to get the answer:

fgt,fpq,nqk,pcp,srn,z07,z24,z32
